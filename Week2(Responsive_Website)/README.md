# Week 2 Creating a responsive e-commerce website 
This is the second task of InternPe internship which is about building a responsive e-commerce website .

I had used HTML,CSS,JavaScript for building a e-commerce front-end website . In the website we have different sections which are navigation menu , banner section , products list section , and next news letter section finally footer section. I had only completed buiding up a front-end website only , it is not a fully completed website because for full website needs some backend technologies . The full website will also be uploaded soon.

# Technologies
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

# What new things I learned while doing this project

1.I had learned about the display element in the css like how to use display element and how to allign the items in the webpage.

2.I had learned about the image,section,padding, margin , pseudo elements which taught me alot of things while doing this project.

3.I had also learned a very import element which is media query which is very helpful for creating a responsive website . In media query element I had learned on how to change the elements based on the configuration of the device . For example , How to allign items and change the size for small devices like Phones , for medium devices like Tablets and for large devices like Desktops , laptops e.t.c.
So,Based on the device configuration the website might change and look good and must be adjustable .
